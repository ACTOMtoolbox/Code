  abstract = {Injection of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the ocean has been proposed as an option for accelerating the natural net flux of CO2 from the atmosphere into the ocean. Liquid CO2 released as droplets at depths {$<$}3000 m will create an ascending plume of droplets and entrained water. As the CO2 droplets dissolve, carbon is transferred into the plume water, yielding increased density and a lowered pH value of the plume water. As ambient water entrains the CO2-enriched water by mixing, the density difference disappears and the injected CO2 follows the ocean dynamics as a dynamically passive tracer. Here we report on numerical experiments performed with a two-phase Navier Stokes solver. The effects of different droplets sizes, background currents, and injection rates are examined. The numerical experiments show that the droplet size and the background current are key parameter for predicting the vertical distribution of the plume water, the associated reduction in the pH field, and the increase in the plume water density. If rapid dilution of the CO2-enriched water is the objective (leading to modest reduction in the pH value), large initial droplets and high background currents are preferable. On the other hand, if the objective is to increase the density of the plume water in order to generate a sinking plume (yielding enhanced residence time of the released CO2), CO2 injection with small droplets in a stagnant water column is optimal.},

A component in designing the monitoring program will be to predict the varying signal caused by an event, here detection of a gas seep through the seafloor from an unknown location. The Bergen Ocean Model (BOM) is used to simulate dispersion of CO2 leaking from different locations in the North Sea, focusing on temporal and spatial variability of the CO2 concentration. It is shown that the statistical footprint depends on seep location and that this will have to be accounted for in designing a network of sensors with highest probability of detecting a seep. As a consequence, heterogeneous probabilistic predictions of CO2 footprints should be available to subsea geological CO2 storage projects in order to meet regulations.},

  abstract = {Understanding the upward motion of CO2 droplets or CH4 bubbles in oceanic waters is prerequisite to predict the vertical distribution of the two most important greenhouse gases in the water column after these have been released from the seabed. One of the key parameters governing the fate of droplets or bubbles dissolving into the surrounding seawater as they rise, is the terminal velocity, uT. The latter is strongly influenced by the ability of both compounds to form skins of gas hydrate, if pressure and temperature satisfy thermodynamic framework conditions. Experimental efforts aiming to elucidate the rise properties of CO2 droplets and CH4 bubbles and specifically the influence of hydrate skins open the possibility to obtain a parameterization of uT applicable to both hydrate-coated and pure fluid particles of CH4 and CO2. With the present study, we report on experimentally determined terminal velocities of single CH4 bubbles released to pressurized and temperature-regulated seawater. Hydrate skins were identified by high bubble sphericities and changed motion characteristics. Based on these experiments as well as published data on the rise of hydrate-coated and pure liquid CO2 droplets and physical principles previously successfully used for clean bubbles near atmospheric pressures, a new parameterization of uT is proposed. Model predictions show a good agreement with the data base established from the laboratory-based measurements.},

  abstract = {Carbon capture and storage is key for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, and offshore geological formations provide vast CO2 storage potential. Monitoring of sub-seabed CO2 storage sites requires that anomalies signifying a loss of containment be detected, and if attributed to storage, quantified and their impact assessed. However, monitoring at or above the seabed is only useful if one can reliably differentiate abnormal signals from natural variability. Baseline acquisition is the default option for describing the natural state, however we argue that a comprehensive baseline assessment is likely expensive and time-bound, given the multi-decadal nature of CCS operations and the dynamic heterogeneity of the marine environment. We present an outline of the elements comprising an efficient marine environmental baseline to support offshore monitoring. We demonstrate that many of these elements can be derived from pre-existing and ongoing sources, not necessarily related to CCS project development. We argue that a sufficient baseline can be achieved by identifying key emergent properties of the system rather than assembling an extensive description of the physical, chemical and biological states. Further, that contemporary comparisons between impacted and non-impacted sites are likely to be as valuable as before and after comparisons. However, as these emergent properties may be nuanced between sites and seasons and comparative studies need to be validated by the careful choice of reference site, a site-specific understanding of the scales of heterogeneity will be an invaluable component of a baseline.},

  abstract = {Sea lice are marine parasites affecting salmon farms, and are considered one of the most costly pests of the salmon aquaculture industry. Infestations of sea lice on farms significantly increase opportunities for the parasite to spread in the surrounding ecosystem, making control of this pest a challenging issue for salmon producers. The complexity of controlling sea lice on salmon farms requires frequent monitoring of the abundance of different sea lice stages over time. Industry-based data sets of counts of lice are amenable to multivariate time-series data analyses. In this study, two sets of multivariate autoregressive state-space models were applied to Chilean sea lice data from six Atlantic salmon production cycles on five isolated farms (at least 20 km seaway distance away from other known active farms), to evaluate the utility of these models for predicting sea lice abundance over time on farms. The models were constructed with different parameter configurations, and the analysis demonstrated large heterogeneity between production cycles for the autoregressive parameter, the effects of chemotherapeutant bath treatments, and the process-error variance. A model allowing for different parameters across production cycles had the best fit and the smallest overall prediction errors. However, pooling information across cycles for the drift and observation error parameters did not substantially affect model performance, thus reducing the number of necessary parameters in the model. Bath treatments had strong but variable effects for reducing sea lice burdens, and these effects were stronger for adult lice than juvenile lice. Our multivariate state-space models were able to handle different sea lice stages and provide predictions for sea lice abundance with reasonable accuracy up to five weeks out.},

We have created a mathematical bottom-up model for a synergistic mixture effect where we fit a multidimensional function to a given data set using an auxiliary nonadditive approach. The toxicokinetic model is based on the data from a previous study on a fish cell line, where the CYP1A enzyme activity was measured over time after exposure to various combinations of the aromatic hydrocarbon β-naphthoflavone and the azole nocodazole. To describe the toxicokinetic mechanism in this pathway and how that affects the CYP1A biomarker, the model uses ordinary differential equations. Local sensitivity and identifiability analyses revealed that all the 10 parameters estimated in the model were identified uniquely while fitting the model to the data for measuring the CYP1A enzyme activity. The model has a good prediction power and is a promising tool to test the synergistic toxicokinetic interactions between different chemicals.},

For this reason, we call the model semi-conditional variational autoencoder. The method, reconstructions, and associated uncertainty estimates are illustrated on the velocity data from simulations of 2D flow around a cylinder and bottom currents from a simulation of the southern North Sea by the Bergen Ocean Model.

  abstract = {If liquid CO2 is stored as a dense “lake” on the deep ocean floor, it is expected to dissolve in seawater. Ocean currents and turbulence can increase the net rate of CO2 release by several orders of magnitude compared to molecular diffusion. However, density stratification in the seawater created by dissolved CO2 will tend to reduce vertical mixing. A two-dimensional numerical study with a high-resolution advection-diffusion model, coupled with a general turbulence model, reveals significant modifications of the boundary layer structure above a generic CO2 lake taken to be 500 m in length and placed in a 10 km domain that is subject to specified far-field currents in the range of 0.05–0.20 m s−1. Dissolution rates of order 0.07 μmol cm−2 s−1, reaching approximately 0.5 μmol cm−2 s−1 during a benthic storm, are predicted. The friction velocity is reduced above the CO2 lake, and CO2 concentrations corresponding to excess water densities of up to 0.5 kg m−3 occur in the lower 10 m of the water column. The persistency of this low-pH, CO2-enriched water layer in weakly stratified and neutral background conditions in the model suggests that gravity current dynamics are important over considerable distances and should be considered in future larger-scale models and impact studies.},

  abstract = {Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a potential significant mitigation strategy to combat climate change and ocean acidification. The technology is well understood but its current implementation must be scaled up nearly by a hundredfold to become an effective tool that helps meet mitigation targets. Regulations require monitoring and verification at storage sites, and reliable monitoring strategies for detection and quantification of seepage of the stored carbon need to be developed. The Cseep method was developed for reliable determination of CO2 seepage signal in seawater by estimating and filtering out natural variations in dissolved inorganic carbon (C). In this work, we analysed data from the first-ever subsea CO2 release experiment performed in the north-western North Sea by the EU STEMM−CCS project. We successfully demonstrated the ability of the Cseep method to (i) predict natural C variations around the Goldeneye site over seasonal to interannual time scales; (ii) establish a process-based baseline C concentration with minimal variability; (iii) determine CO2 seepage detection threshold (DT) to reliably differentiate released−CO2 signal from natural variability and quantify released−CO2 dissolved in the sampled seawater. DT values were around 20 \% of the natural C variations indicating high sensitivity of the method. Moreover, with the availability of DT value, the identification of released−CO2 required no pre-knowledge of seepage occurrence, but we used additional available information to assess the confidence of the results. Overall, the Cseep method features high sensitivity, automation suitability, and represents a powerful future monitoring tool both for large and confined marine areas.},

  abstract = {The dynamics and plume development of injected CO2 dispersion and dissolution through sediments into water column, at the STEMM-CCS field experiment conducted in Goldeneye, are simulated and predicted by a newly developed two-phase flow model based on Navier-Stokes-Darcy equations. In the experiment, CO2 gas was released into shallow marine sediment 3.0 m below the seafloor at 120 m water depth in the North Sea. The pre-experimental survey data of porosity, grain size distributions, and brine concentration are used to reconstruct the model sediments. The gas CO2 is then injected into the sediments at a rate of 5.7 kg/day to 143 kg/day. The model is validated by diagnostic simulations to compare with field observation data of CO2 eruption time, changes in pH in sediments, and the gas leakage rates. Then the dynamics of the CO2 plume development in the sediments are investigated by model simulations, including the leakage pathways, the fluids interactions among CO2/brine/sediments, and CO2 dissolution, in order to comprehend the mechanisms of CO2 leakage through sediments. It is shown from model simulations that the CO2 plume develops horizontally in the sediments at a rate of 0.375 m/day, CO2 dissolution in the sediments is at an overall average rate of 0.03 g/sec with some peaks of 0.45 g/sec, 0.15 g/sec, and 0.3 g/sec, respectively, following the increase in injection rates, when some fresh brine provided. These, therefore, lead to a ratio of 0.90\textasciitilde 0.93 of CO2 leakage rate to injection rate.},
