The ACTOM toolbox (shown in Figure 1.) equips operators with the ability to plan strategies under site-specific conditions and provides regulators a reliable and independent assessment of proposed monitoring strategies from license applicants. In addition to the tool assisting in the technical design of monitoring programs, it can be used to enhance communication with governments and the public in view of Marine Spatial Planning and Responsible Research and Innovation.

<li>Enables regulators to quantifiably assess that a proposed monitoring strategy delivers an acceptable standard of assurance.</li>
<li>Enables operators to properly plan, cost and adapt monitoring strategies to site specific circumstances.</li>
<li>Enables regulators and operators to communicate to the effectiveness of proposed monitoring strategies to enable informed societal consensus in view of marine spatial planning.
