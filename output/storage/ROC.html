<h4>Rate of Change Anomaly Criteria</h4>
Understanding that natural processes that affect the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in seawater tend to have particular temporal scales, for example there are the daily and seasonal cycles of photosynthesis, depending on irradiance, whilst mixing depends on larger scale circulation processes as well as the diurnal tidal cycle. Utilising the fact that given the mobility of CO<sub>2</sub>  plumes, sensors (whether fixed or themselves mobile) are likely to be exposed to fluctuations in CO<sub>2</sub>  over space and timescales that are different from the natural spatiotemporal gradients (<a href="#References">Alendal et al., 2017</a>; <a href="#References">Blackford et al., 2017</a>), analysis of observational data augmented by comprehensive model results have allowed us to quantify the maximum expected natural change in CO<sub>2</sub> as a function of the time between samples. From this, if we know the rate at which a sensor will sample a particular area, we can determine the change of pH over that time period which can be used to identify anomalous signals (<a href="#References">Blackford et al., 2017</a>).
