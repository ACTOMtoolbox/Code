{{ INPUTBYUSER }}

The research in ACTOM works for the advancement of offshore monitoring to ensure alignment of CO<sub>2</sub> storage projects with national and international regulations and societal concerns. The ACTOM Decision Support Tool (DST, shown in Figure 1.) equips operators with the ability to plan strategies under site-specific conditions and provides regulators a reliable and independent assessment of proposed monitoring strategies from license applicants. In addition to the tool assisting in the technical design of monitoring programs, it can be used to enhance communication with governments and the public in view of Marine Spatial Planning and Responsible Research and Innovation. 
<br><br>
The DST is designed to provide value over a range of field cases with diverse subsurface geology and environmental marine characteristics. The end-product of the DST is to aid users in defining a monitoring plan that will satisfy local stakeholders.
<br><br>
The ACTOM DST contains algorithms for determining how the main monitoring aims required by guidance and regulations can be achieved at each site. Namely the algorithm optimizes approaches for detecting anomalies that could signal leakage in the marine environment, and then determining if these anomalies represent leakage. This is not an easy task because CO<sub>2</sub> is already an integral and dynamic part of the marine environment. Which is already undergoing shifts due to climate change. Through using geophysical data on shallow features such as chimneys or fractures, the likely areas where leakage would emanate can be predicted. Knowing the hydrodynamics and bio-chemical processes in marine sediments and seawater allow strategies for location and attribution, setting trigger points for when more action is needed and what instruments can be used for measurements, can be optimized for finding and attributing leakage emissions accounting and environmental protection.
<br><br>
The DST has recently been updated to allow the impact tracking of hypersaline brine water releases or disposal on the seabed as part of reservoir pressure management for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). Some of the tools are dedicated to CO<sub>2</sub> only, such as the carbonate system and C<sub>seep</sub>. Therefore, these will not be possible to select in hypersaline brine mode.

<h3>Site Specific Data</h3>

The DST requires multiple sources of site-specific data for input as shown in Figure 1. These include 1) subsurface geophysical/geological data, where will the CO<sub>2</sub> most likely reach the seafloor, 2) hydrodynamic data, how local currents will drive the CO<sub>2</sub> transport and 3) marine biogeochemical data, to what extent will the signal be hidden within natural variability.
<br>
<h4>Geological mapping, where will the CO<sub>2</sub> potentially reach the seafloor?</h4>

The first challenge of applying the DST is to map the areas of variable risk for releases reaching the sediment surface. Ideally, quantification of risk should involve interpretation and analysis of injection and migration in the overburden, which in turn depends on having access to data and models of each reservoir and the resources to carry out a detailed risk assessment in practice, this step can be resource intensive, and the value of a detailed approach should be evaluated. Indicators of potential pathways such as faults or chimneys are commonly characterised using site specific seismic surveys and subsurface transport simulations. The desired output from these geophysical surveys is the relative likelihood of leakage events at the sediment surface.
<br><br>
However, geophysical data taken from 3D seismic surveys of the shallow subsurface is not always available and is expensive to get and process. Further, the state-of-the-art modelling also come with a considerable price tag and may not be sufficiently reliable to support such risk analyses. The added impact of geological architecture and structural elements like faults, stratigraphic traps, spill points etc. could also be considered.

<h4>Ocean current conditions, predict transport and rate of dilution of the signal.</h4>
Once the seepage has reached the water column it will form bubble or droplet trains or plumes, depending on release, depth and temperature, and gradually be disspersed into the seawater (<a href="#References">Alendal and Drange, 2001</a>; <a href="#References">Dewar et al., 2015</a>), and transported (and further diluted) by local current conditions (<a href="#References">Drange et al, 2001</a>).
In an ideal setting, hydrodynamic data can be readily attained from calibrated high-resolution models and simulations, combined with available in-situ measurements. The process of identifying data availability, and later gathering and pre-processing the data, will have to be site specific. It might be necessary to set up a general circulation model for the area, which can be a considerable task. However, such model systems are often used in regional weather forecasts, in climate research, and as part of marine research and management. Many regional models are in operational use, in Norway NORKYST 800 (<a href="#References">Albretsen et al., 2001</a>, <a href="#References">Asplin et al., 2020</a>,), or being used for process studies. Given all other uncertainties and assumptions made, data from such models provide is adequate for our purpose (<a href="#References">Blackford et al., 2020</a>).<br><br>
