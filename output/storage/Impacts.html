<h3>Impact Potential</h3>
Post-processing produces maps of the impact fields in detail and identifies where detectable anomalies occur based on the criteria defined in the data analytics and impact thresholds. The impact potential is predicted by analysis of the geometry and size of these areas. An environmental impact assessment requires consideration of the spatial and temporal extent of harmful geochemical changes that may occur in the event of a release, along with an understanding of the sensitivity of the proximate ecosystem. The latter is complex, depending on species present, their activity and the presence of other stressors. However, a first order assessment can be derived by understanding the spatial extent elevated beyond a given threshold deemed problematic, for a given set of events. Using results of scenario ensembles generated by the plume simulator this tool derives the spatial-temporal footprint defined by a standard set of thresholds for a range of events (<a href="#References">Blackford et al., 2020</a>).
