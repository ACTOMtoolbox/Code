<h3>Discussion and Summary</h3>
This toolkit developed can be deployed at the planning stage of offshore storage to make evidence-based decisions for monitoring strategies based on deployment cost, likelihood of detection (assurance) and environmental impact potential. During the operational phase should some geological non-conformity necessitate additional environmental monitoring. Whereas the end-product of the toolbox is to aid users in defining a monitoring plan that will satisfy local stakeholders, one intermediate outcome is also to understand how data quality and availability as well as site variability will affect the development of the monitoring plan and how the toolbox can address regional concerns and be tuned to local characteristics. For this assessment the process of identifying data availability, and later gather and pre-processing the data, will have to be site specific.

The quality of results from the toolbox will of course depend on the quality of the data given to the toolbox. The advantage of the simplified transport model used in the ACTOM toolbox, is that it allows fast rescaling and quick recalculation of the model outcomes. In a site study, an ensemble of current conditions should be performed.  However, since the advection-diffusion equation is linear, the flux rates can be scaled and concentrations from various locations can be summed. As an example, to simulate scenarios in which only some of the probable locations seeps and to alter the flux rates at these can be done without rerunning the advection diffusion model. Such an ensemble would also use the geological mapping to much higher degree, drawing scenarios based on the probabilities provided. This will also be the first step in quantifying uncertainties in a monitoring program, including avoiding false positives (that an alarm is raised when no seep is present) and assure our belief that we will be able to detect a seep, i.e., avoid false negatives.

In developing the toolbox, we have always considered the stakeholders, with a larger and varied representation in our advisory board we have always asked what will the operators want in terms of toolbox functionality? Looking at cost (both capital expenditure and operating expenditure), uncertainty envelopes of detection over the reservoir, risk of false positives/negatives, how to implement the monitoring plan and how to modify monitoring in the light of evolving circumstances. A challenge will be to ensure that the toolbox remains current, i.e. as (monitoring) technology develops, its capabilities can be considered in deriving optimal monitoring strategies.
