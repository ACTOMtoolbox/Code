<h4>C<sub>seep</sub></h4>

The baseline carbonate values are provided by the data analytics of the local biochemical characteristics. <i>C<sub>seep</sub></i> (<a href="#References">Botnen et al., 2015</a> and <a href="#References">Omar et al., 2021</a>) analyses survey or modelled biogeochemical data, estimating and filtering out natural variations in dissolved inorganic carbon (<i>DIC</i>). This tool uses knowledge of the seawater CO<sub>2</sub> system, as well as the natural processes affecting it. The method assumes that fluctuating DIC component (<i>Î”C</i>) governed by natural variability and/or seeps is superimposed on a nearly constant theoretical baseline DIC concentration (<i>C<sub>b</sub></i>), which is dictated by the history and physical properties of the water. Specifically, the method determines <i>C<sub>b</sub></i> by using site specific model, based on stoichiometric and empirical relationships, to adjust all DIC data to common values of salinity, nutrients, total alkalinity, and year (<a href="#References">Omar et al., 2021</a>). In principle, <i>C<sub>b</sub></i> determined this way should be constant. In practice, however, <i>C<sub>b</sub></i> includes some fluctuations due to processes not resolved well enough by the model and parameter uncertainties. An important implication of this is that the uncertainty in <i>C<sub>b</sub></i> determines the detection threshold of the <i>C<sub>seep</sub></i> method. To ensure <i>C<sub>b</sub></i> with minimal uncertainty, a sound site-specific baseline characterization is needed. Ideally, the baseline study should include measurements from the area being monitored during a period long enough to capture the seasonal and annual variability and long-term trends. Thus, the <i>C<sub>seep</sub></i> method first establishes <i>C<sub>b</sub></i> against which monitoring data can be compared by creating a threshold over which may indicate an anomaly in monitoring that should be investigated.
