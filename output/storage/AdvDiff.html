<h3>Advection-Diffusion Module (Tracer Transport Simulator)</h3>

Hydrodynamic model systems can describe physical flows, sometimes including two-component multiphase models, used to simulate dynamic plume in the neighbourhood of a seep. These models are valuable for understanding the behaviour of discharge trail. However, they are too computationally demanding for ensemble simulations and parameters estimation. If the tracer can be considered diluted enough to not influence on the water density, it will have no impact on the current dynamics. This allows the use of velocity fields obtained from the complex ocean circulation models to drive simpler advection-diffusion type transport models.<br><br> 

The transport simulator solves numerically the advection-diffusion equation for plume dispersion using FiPy, the partial differential equation solver based on a standard finite volume approach, <a href="#References">(Guyer et al. 2009)</a>.<br><br>

The transport simulation uses the ocean velocities, and the identified risk maps as an input, and provides evolving fields of tracer concentrations and their statistics on an ensemble of leak simulations from point sources. Due to the linearity of the advection-diffusion equation and assumption on the constant flux, transport simulator allows to run the simulation for each source only once and then assemble the solution by scaling and summing the contribution from each source, as a postprocessing step. This allows to utilize parallel computing capabilities of multi-core CPUs and generate multiple possible scenarios from running the simulator only once.<br><br>

The simulator allows to store local fields, local statistics, and construct global solution fields which describing the behaviour of all the sources acting together. 

<br><br>The transport simulator it is a powerful tool used to create various leak scenarios that can help to detect accumulation zones and to create deterministic or probabilistic footprints.<br><br>
