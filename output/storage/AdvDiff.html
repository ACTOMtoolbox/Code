<h3>Advection-Diffusion Module (Tracer Transport Simulator)</h3>

Hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model systems describe both physical flows and biogeochemical fluxes, including CO<sub>2</sub> chemistry, sometimes including two-component multiphase models, are used to simulate dynamic plume in the neighbourhood of a seep. These models are valuable for understanding the biogeochemical baseline and the behaviour of discharge trail. However, they are too computationally demanding for ensemble simulations and parameters estimation. If the tracer, here CO<sub>2</sub>, can be considered diluted enough to not influence on the water density, it will have no impact on the current dynamics. This allows the use of velocity fields obtained from the complex ocean circulation models to drive simplified advection-diffusion-reaction type transport models.<br><br>

The identified risk maps with their relative rates and any intermittency imposed are used by the tracer transport simulator developed by <a href="#References">Oleynik et al., (2018)</a> to provide evolving fields of tracer concentrations on an ensemble of point sources. Assuming a negligible impact on density from the CO<sub>2</sub> allows the use of rapid advection-diffusion algorithms meaning that the computational requirement of high-level advanced simulation models may be dramatically reduced. The tool utilizes parallel computing capabilities of multi-core CPUs. Each core/thread of the CPU works with a single source at any given time, and each source is solved for on individual local grids. As the advection-diffusion equation is a linear Partial Differential Equation (PDE), the aggregate solution is assembled by simply summing the contributions from each local solution together. As such, we can construct a global solution which describes the behaviour of all the sources acting together. This has several advantages over solving all sources together on the same global grid. For one, it allows us to utilize parallelization as each source is solved separately. Moreover, it gives us the ability to generate multiple possible scenarios from running the module only once. As each source is stored separately on individual local grids, the resulting global outcome can be changed by weighting the contributions from each source independently, therefore, the tool is able to account for many possible scenarios without having to repeat simulations.
