From the measured or modelled  3D seismic or acoustic datasets containing gas anomalies that have been inputted to the near-surface geophysical characterisation and automated gas anomaly detection tool, Synthetic probability maps are configured to identify specific targets for monitoring at each named location inputted: {{ GEO_1_lab }},  as shown in Figure{{ GEO_1_figs }}. The shaded areas indicate potential risk regions.
