<h3>Anomaly Criteria Identification </h3>

Perturbations arising from a release may be small, and of a similar magnitude to natural changes in CO<sub>2</sub> concentration especially if monitored at some distance from a release point. The challenge therefore is to develop highly sensitive criteria that identify anomalous chemistry as distinct from natural dynamics, minimizing the chance for false positives. By combining models of release scenarios and natural variability we can use these models to identify optimal detection criteria, identifying the most sensitive discriminators applicable to a given site or even season and identify the site-specific detection threshold.
