<h3>Deployment strategies - Optimal Cover</h3>

Deployment strategies based on optimization techniques and a classical set cover problem are used in the optimal sensor placement tool (<a href="#References">Oleynik et al., 2019</a>). These techniques are based on cross correlations of all the data streams reducing issued alerts and false alerts by giving the best sensor placement to detect an anomaly based on the simulations. The goal is to find the optimal sensors placement in the region to detect all potential anomalies above background fluctuations whilst minimising the number of required sensors. The exact location for each sensor can be found in the netcdf files produced in the output files from the optimal sensor placement tool.
